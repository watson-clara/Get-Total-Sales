# Get-Total-Sales
This program gets the sales reports from each of the databases and then queries them to find the daily initial sales, recurring sales, and new deals.

## Usage
This is a program I designed at my old job to automate one of my daily tasks. Each day we upload daily sales reports to google sheets. This program uses the already created sheets to give a summary of the sales data.
